Three rules for "tidy" data:
1. Each variable must have its own column
2. Each observation must have its own row
3. Each value must have its own cell


We expect data to be arranged in a way that preserves relationships


Formats: Long vs Wide
Long: every row represents an observation belonging to a certain category
Wide: each observation is spread across multiple columns

```{r}
# run libraries at start
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(skimr)
```


```{r}
#create subject info tibble
subject_hr <- tibble( name = c("SUBJ01","SUBJ02","SUBJ03"), 
  hr_am = c(68,72,68), 
  hr_pm = c(58,89,52))

subject_hr
```
pivot_longer

```{r}
subject_hr %>% 
pivot_longer(
  cols = hr_am:hr_pm,
  names_to = "measurement_time",
  values_to = "heartrate"
)
```
use tidyr on real data

```{r}
visits <- read_csv("data/hospitals93to98.csv")
view(visits)
```

pivot_longer()

```{r}
visits_long <- visits %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = FY1993:FY1998,
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "visit_count"
  )

head(visits_long)
```
pivot_wider() on the field

```{r}
visits_wide <- visits_long %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Field",
              values_from = "visit_count")

head(visits_wide, 20)
```

separate() - splitting one column into many

```{r}
visits_tidy <- visits_wide %>% 
  separate(
    col = IcdChapter,
    into = c("code", "description"),
    sep = "\\. "
  )

visits_tidy
```
