This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
# run libraries at start
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(skimr)
```

```{r}
video_games <-read_csv("data/steam-200k-sample.csv", skip = 4) #skip = removing top 4 lines of metadata
```

###check variable types

```{r}
video_games_clean <- video_games %>% 
  mutate(`bought online` = as.logical(`bought online`)) #need a back tick as column name had a space, otherwise will be an error
```

###fixing variable names

```{r}
video_games_clean %>% 
  names() # kept empty as piped in
```

```{r}
library(janitor)

video_games_clean <- video_games_clean %>% 
  clean_names()

video_games_clean %>% 
  names()
```


###Let's rename some column names

```{r}
#name you want from name it currently is

video_games_renamed <- video_games_clean %>% 
  rename("game_title" = "game_name", 
         "activity" = "what",
         "playing_hours" = "value")


video_games_renamed %>% 
  names()
         
```
